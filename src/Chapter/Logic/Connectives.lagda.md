The logic we have been using so far is based on a limited set of
Agda types:

* **Logical implication** corresponds to the *arrow type*: a proof
  of `A -> B` is a function that, applied to a proof of `A`, yields
  a proof of `B`.
* **Universal quantification** corresponds to the **dependent arrow
  type**: a proof of `∀(x : A) -> B` is a function that, applied to
  an element `x` of type `A`, yields a proof of `B` (where `x` may
  occur in `B`).
* **Equality** `E ≡ F` is the type of proofs showing that `E` is
  equal to `F`. In order to prove equalities we have used
  *reflexivity* and equational reasoning.

In general, we will need a richer set of logical connectives in
order to prove interesting properties of programs. For example, to
prove the correctness of a sorting function on lists we must be able
to state that the list resulting from the function is sorted *and*
that it is also a permutation of the original list. This property is
the *conjunction* of two sub-properties of lists, that is being
sorted and being a permutation of another list. In this chapter we
will see how to represent **conjunction**, **disjunction**,
**truth** and **falsity** in constructive logic by means of suitably
defined data types.

## Imports

```
open import Function using (const; id; _∘_)
open import Data.Bool using (Bool; true; false)
open import Data.Nat
open import Relation.Binary.PropositionalEquality
```

## Conjunction

In constructive logic, a proof of *`A` and `B`* is a **pair** `(p ,
q)` consisting of a proof `p` of `A` and a proof `q` of `B`. Thus,
we can define conjunction as a data type for representing
pairs. Naturally, the data type will be parametric in the type of
the two components of the pair.

```
data _×_ (A B : Set) : Set where
  _,_ : A -> B -> A × B
```

Notice that we have chosen an infix form for both the data type
`_×_` and its constructor `_,_`. In this way, we will be able to
write `A × B` for the type of pairs whose first component has type
`A` and whose second component has type `B`. Analogously, we will be
able to write `p , q` for the pair whose first component is `p` and
whose second component is `q`. We specify the fixity of `×` and `,`
so that they are both right associative.

```
infixr 3 _×_
infixr 4 _,_
```

For example, `A × B × C` means `A × (B × C)` and `p , q , r` means
`p , (q , r)`.

The most common way of "consuming" pairs is by performing case
analysis on them. Since the `_×_` data type has only one
constructor, when we perform case analysis we end up considering
just one case in which the pair has the form `(x , y)`. As an
example, we can define two projections `fst` and `snd` that allow us
to access the two components of a pair.

```
fst : ∀{A B : Set} -> A × B -> A
fst (x , _) = x

snd : ∀{A B : Set} -> A × B -> B
snd (_ , y) = y
```

Note that `fst` and `snd` are also proofs of two well-known theorems
about conjunctions: if `A × B` is true, then `A` is true (`fst`) and
`B` is true (`snd`).

By combining conjunction (given by the data type `×`) and
implication (given by the native Agda's arrow type `->`) we can also
model double implication, commonly known as "if and only if".

```
_⇔_ : Set -> Set -> Set
A ⇔ B = (A -> B) × (B -> A)
```

<!--
```
infixr 1 _⇔_
```
-->

## Disjunction

In constructive logic, a proof of *`A` or `B`* is either a proof of
`A` or a proof of `B` together with an indication of which proof we
are providing. This interpretation suggests the representation of
disjunction `⊎` as a data type with two constructors, one taking a
proof of `A` and the other taking a proof of `B`, to yield a proof
of `A ⊎ B`. The name of the constructor indicates which of the two
proofs is provided. We call the two constructors `inj₁` and `inj₂` for
"inject left" and "inject right".

```
data _⊎_ (A B : Set) : Set where
  inj₁ : A -> A ⊎ B
  inj₂ : B -> A ⊎ B
```

We declare `⊎` as a right associative operator with smaller
precedence than `×`.

```
infixr 2 _⊎_
```

As for conjunctions, we will use case analysis on terms of type `A ⊎
B`. As an example, we can formulate the elimination principle for
disjunctions as the following function.

```
⊎-elim : ∀{A B C : Set} -> (A -> C) -> (B -> C) -> A ⊎ B -> C
⊎-elim f g (inj₁ x) = f x
⊎-elim f g (inj₂ x) = g x
```

For instance, we can use `⊎-elim` to prove that disjunction is
commutative:

```
⊎-comm : ∀{A B : Set} -> A ⊎ B -> B ⊎ A
⊎-comm = ⊎-elim inj₂ inj₁
```

## Truth

The always true proposition `⊤` is represented as a data type with a
single constructor without arguments. That is, truth is a
proposition for which we can provide a proof without any effort.

```
data ⊤ : Set where
  tt : ⊤
```

## Falsity

The always false proposition `⊥` must not be provable. As such, we
can represent it by a data type without constructors.

```
data ⊥ : Set where
```

The elimination principle for `⊥` is sometimes called *principle of
explosion* or *ex falso quodlibet*. It states that if it is possible
to prove `⊥`, then it is possible to prove anything. Stating this
principle in Agda requires the use of the **absurd pattern**.

```
ex-falso : ∀{A : Set} -> ⊥ -> A
ex-falso ()
```

The pattern `()` in the definition of `ex-falso` matches an
hypothetical value of type `⊥`. Since no constructor is provided for
`⊥` and no such value may exist, the equation *has no right hand
side* (note that there is no equal sign) and we are not obliged to
provide a proof of `A` as required by the codomain of `ex-falso`.

In other programming languages that are capable of defining a data
type analogous to `⊥` it is possible to assign the type `⊥` to
non-terminating expressions. If this were allowed also in Agda, the
whole language would be useless insofar program verification is
concerned, since `ex-falso` would easily allow us to prove *any*
property about *any* program. For this reason, Agda has a
*termination checker* making sure that every definition is
*terminating*. For example, if define `loop` as follows

<!--
```
{-# TERMINATING #-}
```
-->
```
loop : ℕ -> ⊥
loop n = loop (suc n)
```

Agda reports that this definition does not pass the termination
check. Indeed, `loop` is recursively applied to increasingly larger
arguments. An even simpler example of non-terminating definition is
`bottom`, shown below.

<!--
```
{-# TERMINATING #-}
```
-->
```
bottom : ⊥
bottom = bottom
```

All the recursive functions we have defined until now are verified
by Agda to be *terminating* because there is an argument that
becomes *structurally smaller* from an application of the function
to its recursive invocation. Structural recursion applies to a large
family of functions, but some of them
<!--
(e.g. [division](Chapter.Fun.Division.html) or [quick
sort](Chapter.Fun.QuickSort.html))
-->
cannot be easily formulated in this way. We will see a general
technique for having these functions accepted by Agda in later
sections.
